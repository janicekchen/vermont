Vermont, before it was deemed as such, is, and has been, the heartland of the Western Abenaki people. Under towering American beeches and red maples, they beat back brush and carved silent hunting paths along the forest floor. Hillside pockets were burned to make clearings for settlement, or to lure deer to new tree lines. Squash, corn, and beans were planted in fields rotated every season. The landscape has always been dynamic, shifting with the ebb and flow of community, of war and of disease.

            But it wasn’t until the mass migration of White settlers in the late 18th century that the forest was excavated in broad swaths to form the sweeping vistas that we are more familiar with today. In the decade following Vermont’s admission to the Union in 1791, nearly 70,000 settlers flocked to the region and doubled the state’s population. They snapped up land [tk sentence something about proprietors].

        This landscape of open fields and forest saw its first iteration with the
        mass migration of white settlers to Vermont in the late 18th century. In
        the decade following Vermont's admission to the union in 1791, the
        population nearly doubled. Forests were rapidly cleared to make way for
        farmland. Early on, the trees were girdled; a strip of bark would be hacked
        away from the base of each tree in a narrow ring. Over several years, the
        roots would wither, cut off from the sugars made in the leaves. 
    <p>
        In later
        years, the trees would simply be felled and left to dry over the winter. The
        land cleared faster this way.

    <p>The logs would be sent down river to become lumber or burned to make potash. Even then, 
        Vermont was overlain with pathways of global trade: the potash would be exported to 
        England for use in its growing textile industry. For most settlers, the additional 
        income went toward paying off the land.
