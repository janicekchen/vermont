        This landscape of open fields and forest saw its first iteration with the
        mass migration of white settlers to Vermont in the late 18th century. In
        the decade following Vermont's admission to the union in 1791, the
        population nearly doubled. Forests were rapidly cleared to make way for
        farmland. Early on, the trees were girdled; a strip of bark would be hacked
        away from the base of each tree in a narrow ring. Over several years, the
        roots would wither, cut off from the sugars made in the leaves. 
    <p>
        In later
        years, the trees would simply be felled and left to dry over the winter. The
        land cleared faster this way.
    </p>
    <p>The logs would be sent down river to become lumber or burned to make potash, 
        a chemical compound that'd be leached from the ash in big wooden vats. Even then, 
        Vermont was overlain with pathways of global trade: the potash would be exported to 
        England for use in its growing textile industry. For most settlers, the additional 
        income went toward paying off the land.</p>

Women in cities had begun to feed cow's milk to their infants, spurred on by social reformers, and left without the wet nurse networks that characterized motherhood in rural 19th century New England. <br> <br>In cities, the social relations that had facilitated shared breastfeeding unraveled. Dairies popped up in ccities—usually "swill dairies", operations attached to distilleries that supplied fermented mash as feed for the cows. <a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

Swill dairies, usually foul and unpleasant operations, were outlawed. That, coupled with ballooning urban populations and rising land costs, necessitated the market's expansion. <a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
