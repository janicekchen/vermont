					<span class = "dropcap">I</span>n the small towns and villages of Vermont, cracked asphalt roads cut by farmhouses more than a hundred years old, their white siding and black shingles unchanged, and the barns behind them—many red, some turquoise, some blue. Beyond the barns, hay fields swell and dip before meeting a forested horizon. On pastures, dairy cows pull at the grass until their noses brush against the earth come autumn. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a humming nostalgia written in these rolling hills: a nostalgia for community, for a simpler and more earth-bound past. In the late 60s and early 70s, young people who grew up in the suburbs and cities came to the state in droves, trundling up narrow valley roads in secondhand trucks and settling in forgotten farmhouses. The back-to-the-land movement grew out of a growing discontentment at the time with postindustrial life—the smog of the city, the disconnect with food at the dinner table. Vermont, for them, symbolized a pastoral ideal. It was an antidote to the woes of capitalism.
				</p>
				<p>But these ribbons of farmland are anything but an unchanging past. Over the past four centuries, the threads of trade and conflict have tugged at this landscape, making and remaking these hills into an illusion of pastoral escape—an illusion entwined in, and not at remove from urban life. </p>

						<span class = "dropcap" style = "width: 0.7em">F</span>or millennia, these forests have rarely been left undisturbed. This is the heartland of the Western Abenaki people. Under towering American beeches and red maples, they beat back brush and carved silent hunting paths across the forest floor. Hillside pockets were burned to make clearings for settlement, or to lure deer to new tree lines. Beginning in the 1000 A.D. Squash, corn, and beans were planted in fields rotated every season. The landscape has always been dynamic, shifting with the ebb and flow of community, of war and disease.
					</p>
					<p>
						But it wasn’t until the mass migration of White settlers in the late 18th century that the forest was almost altogether excavated to form the sweeping vistas that we are more familiar with today. In the decade following Vermont’s admission to the Union in 1791, nearly 70,000 settlers flocked to the region and doubled the state’s population. The soils here are rockier if anything else, but the settlers had been sold an idea of agricultural paradise. They snapped up property lots—new patches of ownership etched into hillsides—and set to clearing the forest for farmland.

					Early on, the trees were girdled; a strip of bark would be hacked away from the base of each tree in a narrow ring. Over several years, the roots would wither, cut off from the sugars made in the leaves.

					<p>The logs would be sent down river to become lumber or burned to make potash. Even then, 
						Vermont was overlain with pathways of global trade: the potash would be exported to 
						England for use in its growing textile industry. For most settlers, the additional 
						income went toward paying off the land.

				<span class = "dropcap" style = "width: 0.75em">T</span>oday, the dairy industry remains one of the biggest forces maintaining the pastoral Vermont landscape. Without the hay combines and dairy cows trimming the fields, the grass would grow tall and eventually wither in yellowing expanses. But as much as the hills have stayed green, rapidly industrializing agriculture across the country has left its mark in Vermont. As dairy farms grow and consolidate, hay fields are replaced with uniform rows of corn; fewer and fewer cows are seen on the hills. Smaller farms are pushed out of business. The forests have grown back in parts. Seeds take root in old, unused pastures, and left untouched, saplings emerge out of the tall grass. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a 2019 survey conducted by Vermont Public Radio and Vermont PBS, 72% of respondents considered dairy to be very important to the state’s sense of self. In part, the tendency to view this particular version of pastoralism as an unchanging and inherent quality of this land has further cemented Vermont’s identity as a dairy state, and bulwarked efforts to resuscitate an industry long plagued by overproduction and falling prices. The bucolic juxtaposition of farm and forest has a short history here, and the enduring dynamism of this landscape suggests something quite contrary to a fixed model of food production and of engaging with the land.

				Things move slower in the Vermont hills. The shifts in landscape are almost imperceptible on the day-to-day. But occasionally, on a walk in the woods, one might stumble upon a stone wall riding low to the ground and not far away, the last of an old farmhouse foundation, slowly being swallowed by a stand of maples. There won’t be any old growth trees there — there are hardly any in the state.
