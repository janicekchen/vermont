					<span class = "dropcap">I</span>n the small towns and villages of Vermont, cracked asphalt roads cut 
					by farmhouses more than a hundred years old, their white siding and 
					black shingles the same, and the barns behind them—many red, some 
					turquoise, some blue. Beyond the barns, hay fields swell and dip 
					before meeting a forested horizon. Dairy cows pull at the grass 
					until their noses brush against the earth come autumn. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a humming nostalgia in these rolling pastures: a nostalgia 
					for community, for a simpler and more earth-bound past. In the late 60s
					and early 70s, young people who grew up in the suburbs and cities came 
					to the state in droves, secondhand trucks and [tk tk] alike trundling 
					up narrow valley roads. The back-to-the-land movement grew out of a
					growing discontentment at the time with postindustrial life—the smog 
					of the city, the disconnect with food at the dinner table. Vermont, for 
					them, symbolized a pastoral ideal. It was an antidote to capitalism.

				<p>The arrival of Merino sheep brought more trade to Vermont. Valued by the Spanish for their thick wool, Merinos soon replaced the English breeds that had been mostly raised for mutton.</p>

				<p style = "color: white">As wool production migrated west, a new industry spread out across the rural Northeast. Women in cities had begun to feed cow's milk to their infants, spurred on by social reformers, and left without the wet nurse networks that characterized motherhood in rural 19th century New England. <br> <br>In cities, the social relations that had facilitated shared breastfeeding unraveled. Dairies popped up in ccities—usually "swill dairies", operations attached to distilleries that supplied fermented mash as feed for the cows. <a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

				<p>Although the railroad became a viable means to transport milk in the 1840s, it wasn't until the late 1800s that the dairy industry spidered into the countryside. Swill dairies, usually foul and unpleasant operations, were outlawed. That, coupled with ballooning urban populations and rising land costs, necessitated the market's expansion. <a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
