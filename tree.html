                        This landscape of open fields and forest saw its first iteration with the
                        mass migration of white settlers to Vermont in the late 18th century. In
                        the decade following Vermont's admission to the union in 1791, the
                        population nearly doubled. Forests were rapidly cleared to make way for
                        farmland. Early on, the trees were girdled; a strip of bark would be hacked
                        away from the base of each tree in a narrow ring.
